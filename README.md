# Self-driving Car Taxi Service Web Project - Front End

(PROJECT IS STILL INCOMPLETE) - https://wyne-ybanez.github.io/self-driving-car-delivery/

## Project Goal

This project aims to create an interactive front end layout for a self-driving car taxi service called 'Fast-Travel'.

The target audience for this project are its customers/users. It will allow them to order a self driving cab which they can customise via a specification form. They can also choose where their starting point and destination is via the Google Maps API feature on the project. 

For the purpose of the project. The options of destination will be kept local.

## UX 

### Strategy 

My goal for the website was to allow the users to order a self driving taxi. It will focus primarily on functionality and ease of use. The website should process the user's input and acknowledge their specifications. It will give them the route the taxi will take and outline their specification options prior to the trip. Providing them an immersive experience.

### Scope 

The website will allow the user to decide the starting point and the destination(s) of his journey where their route is shown on the map. It will then provide the user with more options via a form so that the customer can personally customize their experience. A summary of the user's order should be provided to them. 

### Structure 

The website incorporates a multi-page design. The landing page, the Google Maps form, and the specifications form will be separated and have their own dedicated pages. The pages will be interactive and connected to each other, one page will ultimately lead to another. They shall also acknowledge any buttons the user presses or any preferences the user chooses.

### Skeleton

These wireframes are the blueprints to the project. These were made to help plan the project and see how the features could be implemented. Design decisions were made during the production of the website that may stray from what the wireframes initially conveyed.

  [Specifications Form](assets/wireframes/Specifications.png) 

### Surface

The site focuses primarily on functionality rather than design. The design of the website will be simply made yet elegant, focusing on dark, silver and lightning blue. It uses an mp4 video gif for the landing page. The Maps form page is interactive and will respond when the user interacts with the inputs fields or the map. Their interactions will reflect on the map itself. The specification form page will consist of a simple form and its color scheme will inherit the site's overall theme.

## User Stories:

- ### First Time Visitor Goals:

  a. I would like to know the purpose for the creation of the website from the first instance of opening it.
  <br>
  b. I would greatly appreciate it if the website were easy to navigate.
  <br>
  c. I expect the website to display relevant content and stay consistently relevant as I explore the site.
  <br>

  <br>
  e. I would like the content to be structured and easy to follow.
  
- ### Returning Visitor Goals:
  
  a. I would like to see in-depth information to the website with regards to how the candidate is improving in his ability to code. 
  <br>
  b. I would like to see if the candidate has completed any coding experience with other businesses.
  <br>

## Design - In Depth

### Colour Scheme 

- The overall project will use the colors lightning blue, dark gray, silver and white. 
- The two main contrasting colours for the project are turquoise and blue. This will be complimented with dark and white background/texts.

### Fonts 

- Ubuntu is the font used for the overall project.
- Sans serif is the fallback font should the fonts be imported incorrectly.

### Opening the website: 

- The website should be consistent and objective. It should avoid straying away from promoting the candidate, this may create confusion.

### About Me:

- To display an overview of the candidate, his current skills, a profile image, a summary text and progression bars of his technical ability

- Unlike the wireframe, the placements of the content has switched

- This section of the page will have a call to action buttons, mainly to 'projects' and 'contact me' section.

### Work History Timeline:

- To display the candidate's past work experience.
  
- Follows the 'Timeline' wireframe accordingly

### Transparent Sticky-Navbar: 

- If at any point the user should find themselves lost whilst navigating the website, they should be able to return to the home page or to the page they would like to view easily. 

- Users should be able to traverse to any section of the website at any point in time.

### Contact Form: 

- It would be efficient if there was a way for users to contact the candidate at any point of whilst traversing their website. There is a button 'contact me' on the navigation bar to help with this.
- This feature will require the user to input their contact details via a contact form. 
- First name and the email address is required. 
- If the candidate should ever respond, he/she will then know where/who the response is going to.

### Projects: 
  
- It will display 4 projects. The projects will for the mean time link to external third-party websites however, in future I will link my other completed projects to this section.

- It will consist of 4 projects supported by descriptive text at the side just as specified on the wireframe.

### Footer:
  
- When reaching the end point of the website, there may be a further queries users would like to ask the candidate.
  
- Perhaps the user would like to read back over to the previous content. 
  
- The footer should have the relevant social links and navigation links. These can help users/recruiters to research candidate further or go back over specific content.

## Features

### Responsive: 

  The website should be responsive and confirm all interactions. 

  There should be some sort of indicator or animation that can confirm whenever the user is hovering over a button or clicking on it when using a computer or desktop.

  It should shrink windows and align items correctly when the user is minimizing the window or using a mobile phone. The website should be responsive when viewed on modern devices.

  The website should function accordingly in modern web browsers.

### Interactive: 

  The user should be able to interact with the website and function according to the given text
  i.e. Clicking on 'Contact Me' should bring the user to 'contact.html'.

  Fade animations should be present on accordingly as the user scrolls down.
  
### Convenience: 

  The user should be able to navigate the website at any point in time.
  
  The content of the website should stay relevant and appropriate. 

  The buttons leading to separate pages should appear in good time in preparation for the user's desire to know more about the candidate.

  The content should be clear and presented without any distractions. Ideally the user should know where and what part of the website they are reading/exploring.

### Git Bash Code

- I had initially started the project with a local IDE and a local username. I forgot to configure and log the right username and email for the author. Hence, my initial contributions were not counted by Github.

## Known Bugs

- There is a bug with the carousel indicator `.carousel-indicators li` by which the indicators move up and down when the testimonial section is viewed on mobile device (iPhone 6, 7, 8).

- When viewed on the Macbook Air 2015 - 13", there was a bug where the blue border behind the "About me" image was not styled properly. The `height` and the `bottom` position the blue border did not apply the styles specified in style.css. However, upon viewing it on the Macbook Pro - 13" and testing on [ami responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#), the border followed its styling accordingly. 
  
- When viewed on Github pages using a physical mobile phone, the hero image is not clear nor is it fully presented. The hero image looks zoomed in and the alignment is unknown.

## Design Changes 

- The website used to incorporate a black background, this has been changed to a white background. Text colors and section backgrounds have been changed accordingly

- Previously, the website would link externally to 'projects.html' and 'contactme.html'. These files have been deleted and instead the site incorporates a one page design.

- Previously, it was planned that the Footer would have 3 navigation buttons as specified in the Wireframes. This has been altered and now the footer will now contain navigation links, social icons as well as contact information.

## Future Implementations 

- I would like to style further media queries for the website
- To update the 'projects' section with real projects
- To update the content to show real work experience
- To add a download cv button in the options menu or the footer
- To code additional Javascript animations on the website in future
- I would like for the 'contact me' form to send any contacts to my professional email address
